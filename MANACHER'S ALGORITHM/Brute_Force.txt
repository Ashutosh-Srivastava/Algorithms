Longest Palindromic Substring with Manacher's Algorithm

Prerequisite - I hope that you have understood question very well

Application - To solve Longest Palindromic substring question

Let's first go for Naive Approach AKA Brute Force
This approach is never preffered because it takes O(n^3) time
Reason - Firstly we make every possible substring of given string which takes O(n^2) time
then check every substring if it is palindrome or not takes O(n) time
then maintain maximum value for longest palindromic substring 
Overall -  O(n^2)*O(n) = O(n^3)
